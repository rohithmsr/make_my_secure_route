# Make My Secure Route

This app, created during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic, provides the safest as well as the optimised route between the source and the 
destination in Chennai district, TamilNadu. The reason for me to make this app so that once the lockdown is lifted and offices begin to work, 
the commuters can travel with safety and confidence.

## Tech-Stack

1. The safest n optimised route is fetched using Here Maps Routing API
2. The data of the containment zones is obtained from the [official website of the Greater Chennai Corporation](https://covid.gccservice.in/containmentzones)

## Some Other Features
1. Alerts the user if he is about to travel to a place which is not safe or when there is no safest route possible.
2. English and Tamil Languages to search for a particular place
3. Has some lite route navigation features.
